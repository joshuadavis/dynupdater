# dynupdater

A very simple command line tool that will determine
the IP address of the machine it is running from
and update the IP address in dyn.com for a given
host name.

It reads a YAML config file that looks something like this:
```yaml
user: someuser
clientkey: 12345FFDDEE999
hostname: some.host.name
```
Where
* `someuser` is your dyn.com user name
* `clientkey` is the client key generated by dyn.com
* `hostname` is the host name that you want to update
